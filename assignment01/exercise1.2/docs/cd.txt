cd: cd [-P [-e]] [dir]
    Change the shell working directory.
    
    Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    HOME shell variable.
    
    If DIR begins with a slash (/), then the DIR is treated as an absolute path.

    Options:

    -P  Use the physical directory structure without following symbolic links
    -P -e   Exit with a non-zero status is cannot resolve current working directory
    ~   cd to HOME directory
    --help  Display this help and exit
    
    Error Handling:
        If user tries to cd into a directory where it does not have permissions 
        or the directory doesn't exist, an error is printed.
        If user gives bad input (incorrect flags) then an error is printed.
        If getcwd() throws any error, they are logged on stdout

    Examples:
        cd docs     //Change directory to docs
        cd -P docs  //Change directory to docs without following symbolic links 
        cd ..       //Change to parent directory
        cd ~        //Change to HOME directory
