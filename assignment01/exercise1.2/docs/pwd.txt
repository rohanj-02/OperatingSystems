pwd:	pwd [-L|-P]
	Print the name of current working directory.

	Options:

	-P	Print the physical directory, without any symbolic links
	-L	print the value of pwd with symbolic links

	By default, behaves as if -P was specified.

	Error Handling: 
		If a user enters flags not supported by pwd then the command does
		not run and prints error.
		If program cannot access cwd using getcwd() then throws the error
		as defined by errno via perror() call.
