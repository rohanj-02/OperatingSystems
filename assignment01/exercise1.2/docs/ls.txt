ls: ls [ [-f] [-a] ] [DIR]
	List information about DIR (current directory by default).

	Sorts entries alphabetically unless -f is specified

	Options:

	-f	Does not sort and shows all entries
	-a	Does not ignore entries starting with .
	--help	Display this help and exit

	NOTE: Can club options together by using -fa or -af as flag.

	Error Handling		
		If user gives bad input (incorrect flags) then an error is printed.
		If getcwd() throws any error, they are logged on stdout.
		If user enters name of directory that doesn't exist then, an error
		will be thrown that could not fetch directory.

	Examples:
		ls		//Lists information about current directory
		ls docs		//Lists information about directory docs inside current dir
		ls -a docs	//Shows all files in docs directory
		ls -f 		//Does not sort the list of files printed
